## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

In this project i'll try to reach the design proposal.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users must be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## Deploying the project

The final page for this project, i'll be available at:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
